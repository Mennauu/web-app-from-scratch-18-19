# Web App From Scratch @cmda-minor-web 18-19

A Pok√©dex that shows all the Pokemons. It currently displays these properties: image, id, name type(s), weight, height and game-stats. The data is retrieved using the [Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.co/).

## Introduction
This Pok√©dex is made as part of a course from @cmda-minor-web 18-19. In this course I had to make a Web App without any framework or unnecessary libraries. The idea was to write as much Vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript as possible. The end product is a modular prototype for a single page Web App where data is retrieved from an external API.
