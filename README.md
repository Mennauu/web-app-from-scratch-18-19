# Web App From Scratch @cmda-minor-web 18-19

A Pok√©dex that shows all the Pokemons. It currently displays these properties: image, id, name and type(s). The data is retrieved using the [Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.co/).

# Introduction
This Pok√©dex is made as part of a course from @cmda-minor-web 18-19. In this course I had to make a Web App without any framework or unnecessary libraries (except a router). The idea was to write as much as Vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript as possible. The end product is a modular prototype for a single page Web App where data is retrieved from an external API.

# Data

## Retrieve
In the code beneath the **async / await** method is used to retrieve data from the PokeAPI. The data gets fetched from the API and is converted to JSON.

```Javascript
async function getName() {

  // Get data in JSON
  let response = await fetch('https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/?limit=20')
  let data = await response.json()

  data.results.forEach(results => {

    async function getData() {
      let response = await fetch(`https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/${results.name}/`)
      let data = await response.json()
    }

    getData()
  })
}
```
